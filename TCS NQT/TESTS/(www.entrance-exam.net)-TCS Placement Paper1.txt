Q. 1. In Madras, temperature at noon varies according to -t^2/2 + 8t + 3, where t is elapsed time. Find how much temperature more or less in 4pm to 9pm.

Ans. At 9pm 7.5 more

Sol) In equestion  first put t=9,
we will get 34.5...........................(1)
now put t=4,
we will get 27..............................(2)
so ans=34.5-27
          =7.5

Q. 2. A person had to multiply two numbers. Instead of multiplying by 35, he multiplied by 53 and the product went up by 540. What was the raised product?

a) 780   
b) 1040 
c) 1590 
d) 1720

Sol) x*53-x*35=540=> x=30 therefore, 53*30=1590 Ans

Q. 3. How many positive integer solutions does the equation 2x+3y = 100 have?

a) 50 
b) 33 
c) 16  
d) 35

Sol) There is a simple way to answer this kind of Q's given 2x+3y=100, take l.c.m of 'x' coeff and 'y' coeff i.e. l.c.m of 2,3 ==6then divide 100 with 6 , which turns out 16 hence answer is 16short cut formula--- constant / (l.cm of x coeff and y coeff)

Q. 4 The total expense of a boarding house are partly fixed and partly variable with the number of boarders. The charge is Rs.70 per head when there are 25 boarders and Rs.60 when there are 50 boarders. Find the charge per head when there are 100 boarders.

a) 65  
b) 55 
c) 50 
d) 45

Sol)
Let a = fixed cost and k = variable cost and n = number of boarders
total cost when 25 boarders c = 25*70 = 1750 i.e. 1750 = a + 25k
total cost when 50 boarders c = 50*60 = 3000 i.e. 3000 = a + 50k
solving above 2 eqns, 3000-1750 = 25k i.e. 1250 = 25k i.e. k = 50
therefore, substituting this value of k in either of above 2 eqns we get
a = 500 (a = 3000-50*50 = 500 or a = 1750 - 25*50 = 500)
so total cost when 100 boarders = c = a + 100k = 500 + 100*50 = 5500
so cost per head = 5500/100 = 55

Q. 5 Amal bought 5 pens, 7 pencils and 4 erasers. Rajan bought 6 pens, 8 erasers and 14 pencils for an amount which was half more than what Amal had paid. What % of the total amount paid by Amal was paid for pens?

a) 37.5%   
b) 62.5% 
c) 50% 
d) None of these

Sol)
Let, 5 pens + 7 pencils + 4  erasers = x  rupees
so 10 pens  + 14 pencils + 8 erasers = 2*x rupees
also mentioned, 6 pens + 14 pencils + 8 erarsers = 1.5*x rupees
so (10-6) = 4 pens = (2-1.5)x rupees
so 4 pens = 0.5x rupees => 8 pens = x rupees
so 5 pens = 5x/8 rupees  = 5/8 of total (note x rupees is total amt paid byamal)
i.e 5/8 = 500/8% = 62.5% is the answer

Q. 6. lost Rs.68 in two races. My second race loss is Rs.6 more than the first race. My friend lost Rs.4 more than me in the second race. What is the amount lost by my friend in the second race?

Sol)
x + x+6 = rs 68
2x + 6 = 68
2x = 68-6
2x = 62
x=31
x is the amt lost in I race
x+ 6 = 31+6=37 is lost in second race
then my friend lost 37 + 4 = 41 Rs

Q. 7. Ten boxes are there. Each ball weighs 100 gms. One ball is weighing 90 gms.

i) If there are 3 balls (n=3) in each box, how many times will it take to find 90 gms ball?
ii) Same question with n=10
iii) Same question with n=9

when n=3
(i) nC1= 3C1 =3 for 10 boxes .. 10*3=30

(ii) 10C1=10 for 10 boxes ....10*10=100

(iii)9C1=9 for 10 boxes .....10*9=90

Q. 8. (1-1/6) (1-1/7).... (1- (1/ (n+4))) (1-(1/ (n+5))) = ?

Ans. 5/(n+5)

Q. 9. A face of the clock is divided into three parts. First part hours total is equal to the sum of the second and third part. What is the total of hours in the bigger part?

x+y+z=12
x=y+z
2x=12
x=6
so the largest part is 6 hrs
